          <h2>Change of Major</h2>
          <p>Originally my major of choice was CS because I enjoyed programming and that was what I wanted to persue for my future career. However, though I ended up taken for one semester in CS to see if it is the right fit for me, I discovered that the courses that was in the CS curriculum was not what I wanted to do for the most part.  
            Then I decided to change my major to ITM because the way that CS courses work are much more theoretical and virtual than hands-on learning. This was not the way that I learned as I enjoyed hands-on work and actually doing physical tasks to learn.
            Also, ITM has much more connected interest for me than CS as I have already learned a lot of computer hardware and data network information before entering IIT.</p>

          <h2>Club Experience</h2>
          <p>After I joined IIT last summer, there was almost immediately a club fair happening. 
            Looking through all the clubs before I joined, I discovered that many of the clubs that I wanted to join no longer exists even though they were on IIT's student club website. 
            But I did ended up joining the E-sports club and ACM(Association for Computer Machinery). Starting next semester, I'm considering joining the IIT swimming team as I used to have 4 years of swimming experience.</p>

          <h2>Campus Experience</h2>
          <p>
            Initially, the campus was gigantic to be as a freshman to a university. But I got used to the size of the campus pretty quickly and the buildings on campus are nicely spreaded out and arraged. 
            I visited almost all the common buildings and every floor of the IIT tower as a part of my adventure here on campus. 
            The view of the campus and the scenary is always nice whenever there's snow or in the summer it is full of greenery. The amount of intricate details and effort that were put into designing all the campus buildings are phenomenal and definitely worth it for anyone to visit.</p>
