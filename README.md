This is my submission for Project 3 in the ITMD361 course.

I created 3 different pages for this project during the first two projects (For this current project I added the map page, 2 media queries, and 2 JavaScript tools):
- The first is "Resume" where I store my current resume.
- The second one is "My Experience at IIT" which summarizes my experience after almost a semester and a half at IIT.
- The third one is "Hobbies" and it is the hobbies that I'm into.
- The fourth one is "Map, " which is my personal map made using the Google Maps API.
